# GlobalBooks-SOA-System
GlobalBooks Inc. is struggling with a big, old-fashioned system that is hard to change and slows down during peak demand. Every time they change a single feature, they have to redeploy the whole system, which increases risk and downtime. To solve this, I redesigned the system using Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).
